S1 Nuclease exhibits 3'-phosphomonoesterase activity. The enzyme is a glycoprotein with carbohydrate content of 18%. Applications • Removal of single-stranded overhangs of DNA fragments • S1 transcript mapping • Cleavage of hairpin loops • Creation of unidirectional deletions in DNA fragments in conjunction with Exonuclease III Note S1 Nuclease can introduce breaks into double-stranded DNA, RNA and DNA/RNA hybrids at high enzyme and low salt concentrations.
